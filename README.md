# Elite Math Font
Modern and legacy forms of a standard Elite typewriter font with the mathematical symbols from Dennis Ritchie's draft PhD thesis. 

To use the modern font, put the .ttf files in your font folder; Unicode references apply for Greek letters, and all of the other symbols.

To typeset with groff, I have been using pdfmom, with the font Elite.pfa and afmtodit file ER in both the devps and devpdf folders.

There is a list of functioning escape sequences in the test.mom document, which can be seen in the Test preview.png document.

To work on this font, please feel free to re-engineer the font files, and/or please find the FontLab .vfc and FontForge .sfd documents.

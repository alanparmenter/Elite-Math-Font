# Font
 A work in progress combining the standard Elite typewriter font with the mathematical symbols from Dennis Ritchie's draft PhD thesis. 

To use this font, simply put Elite Math.ttf in your font folder; Unicode references apply for Greek letters, and all of the other symbols.

To work on this font, please feel free to reverse engineer from the font .ttf, but in case you use FontLab, please find the document .vfc.
